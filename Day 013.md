# Android App Links

My most frequently-used app, Medium, uses Android App Links. When you open a Medium link in your browser, it automatically opens the same article in your Medium app, if you have it installed on your device.

Right from the official docs, here's more about Android App Links:

Deep links are URLs that take users directly to specific content in your app. In Android, you can set up deep links by adding intent filters and extracting data from incoming intents to drive users to the right activity.

However, if other apps installed on a user's device can handle the same intent, users might not go directly to your app. For example, clicking a URL in an email from a bank might lead to a dialog asking the user whether to use the browser or the bank's own app to open the link.

Android App Links on Android 6.0 (API level 23) and higher allow an app to designate itself as the default handler of a given type of link. If the user doesn't want the app to be the default handler, they can override this behavior from their device's system settings.
